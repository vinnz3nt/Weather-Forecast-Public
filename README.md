Spatiotemporal Weather Forecasting Project (Public Version)

This is a compressed, public version of a weather forecasting project I have been working on. Large datasets and raw input files have been removed for privacy and size reasons.


Project Structure
src/ – Contains all source code, including models, training scripts, and validation metrics.
experiments/ – Contains trained models along with plots for loss curves and autoregressive predictions.
config.py – Configuration file for project parameters; can be ignored for exploring the code.
setup.py – Module for managing dependencies; not needed to run individual scripts.
weatherforecasting_project.egg-info/ – Metadata about package dependencies; can be ignored.


Notes
This version does not include raw data or large input files (.nc datasets).
Designed for easy inspection of project structure, model code, and example outputs.
